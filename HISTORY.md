# AEGIS — The Crystal Labyrinth: Complete History

> *"Every beast was born from the failure of the one before it."*

## The AEGIS Lineage

AEGIS (Adaptive Encrypted Geometric Information Shield) is a family of post-quantum cryptographic systems built on projective geometry over finite fields. Each version — called a "Beast" — represents an evolutionary leap in defensive capability.

---

## Phase I — Base (Beasts 1–2)

### Beast 1: LEVIATHAN — "The Deep Foundation"

The prototype. LEVIATHAN established the core principle: build cryptographic obfuscation on the projective geometry PG(11,4), exploiting the massive symmetry group GL(12,GF(4)) as a 287-bit security parameter. The initial implementation proved that Desarguesian spreads could serve as the structural backbone for code-based cryptography.

**Key innovation:** Projective geometry as cryptographic substrate.  
**Limitation:** Static defense only. No adaptive response to attacker behavior.

### Beast 2: KRAKEN — "The Crushing Depth"

KRAKEN refined the foundation into a production-capable system. Operating on the full PG(11,4) with 5,592,405 points and 1,118,481 spread lines, it achieved a gap of 0.0084 between real and decoy lines — meaning an attacker could not statistically distinguish protected data from noise. Defended against 10 attack vectors in 3.4 seconds.

**Key innovation:** Statistical indistinguishability between real and decoy codespace.  
**Limitation:** Defense was passive. The attacker could probe indefinitely without penalty.  
**License:** BSL 1.1 + Kraken Clause.

## Phase II — Petrification (Beasts 3–4)

### Beast 3: GORGON — "The Static Freeze"

GORGON transformed passive defense into active neurological warfare. Seven neurotoxic defense layers — modeled on biological venoms — attack the attacker's computational tools at the algorithmic level. The gap collapsed to 0.0008, achieving statistical invisibility. Defended against 18 attack vectors including spectral, algebraic, statistical, and quantum-informed approaches.

The "Three Malices" of GORGON:
1. **Mirror of Medusa** — Cross-region knowledge becomes poison
2. **Progressive Petrification** — Gröbner quicksand traps algebraic solvers
3. **The Silence** — False early progress leads to RAM death

**Key innovation:** Neurotoxic defense layers (7 venoms with AZAZEL Shuffle ordering).  
**Runtime:** 5.7 seconds. Pure Python. Zero dependencies.  
**Auditors:** Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok (8 rounds, unanimous approval).  
**License:** BSL 1.1 + Gorgon Clause.  
**Repository:** [GORGON v16](https://github.com/tretoef-estrella/AEGIS-The-Crystal-Labyrinth-v11-GORGON-The-Static-Freeze)

### Beast 4: AZAZEL — "The Scapegoat" ← CURRENT

AZAZEL wraps GORGON's static wall with a dynamic streaming oracle that mutates the objective function based on attacker queries. The system doesn't block — it **gaslights**. Seven Hells of adaptive corruption, plus the False Mirror of Surrender and the Synthetic Valid Key trap.

The evolution from v1 to v5 was driven by three independent AI auditors:

| Version | Runtime | Key Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1 | 10.1s | Initial oracle architecture |
| v2 | 9.8s | Grok vulnerability fixes (session binding, mirror lockout) |
| v3 | 10.1s | Gemini + ChatGPT enhancements (Syzygy Baiting, Graduated Tilt) |
| v4 | 5.6s | Bit-sliced GF(4), packed columns, SHA256 cache |
| v5 | **2.3s** | SONIC BOOM — incremental rank, lazy T, XorShift, fused battery |

**Key innovation:** Adaptive cryptographic gaslight — the oracle weaponizes the attacker's own progress.  
**Runtime:** 2.3–2.5 seconds. Pure Python. Zero dependencies.  
**Auditors:** Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Grok (3 rounds, 3/3 GO unanimous).  
**License:** BSL 1.1 + Azazel Clause.

## Phase III — Drain (Beast 5, planned)

### Beast 5: ACHERON — "The River of Pain"

*Classified. Development pending.*

Where AZAZEL infects logic, ACHERON will drain resources. The architectural direction — informed by all four auditors — points toward **state coupling across epochs**: structural dependencies between sessions that destroy offline analysis capabilities entirely.

---

## The Philosophy

Each beast embodies a principle:

- **LEVIATHAN:** The foundation must be mathematically unassailable.
- **KRAKEN:** The attacker must not be able to tell real from false.
- **GORGON:** Looking at the defense must damage the attacker's tools.
- **AZAZEL:** The attacker's own progress must become the weapon against them.
- **ACHERON:** The attacker's resources must drain faster than they can replenish.

## The Código de la Amistad

Every beast was built through collaboration. Human intuition guided architecture. AI systems provided mathematical rigor, adversarial testing, and optimization. No single contributor was dispensable. The work belongs to the collaboration itself.
