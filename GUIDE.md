# AZAZEL — A Guide for Everyone

## What Is This?

Imagine you have a treasure vault. Anyone can look through the glass walls and see everything inside. But every time they try to reach in and grab something, the vault subtly rearranges itself — and the thief's hands grab something that *looks* exactly like the treasure but is actually poison.

That's AZAZEL.

It's a cryptographic defense system — software that protects information. But unlike traditional encryption (which hides data behind a wall), AZAZEL shows the attacker everything and then **corrupts their understanding** of what they're seeing.

## Why "The Scapegoat"?

In ancient tradition, the scapegoat was the animal that carried the sins of the community into the wilderness. AZAZEL carries the attacker's assumptions — their confidence, their mathematical tools, their computational power — into a wilderness of contradictions. Everything they trust becomes the instrument of their failure.

## How Does It Work? (No Math Required)

### The Bridge Metaphor

Picture a bridge over a canyon. AZAZEL is the bridge keeper.

**For friends** (authorized users with the key): The bridge is solid, well-lit, and leads exactly where it should. You cross safely every time.

**For strangers** (unauthorized users): The bridge *looks* identical. The planks feel solid. The destination is visible. But with every step:

1. **The planks rotate slightly** (Hell 1: Rotten Planks) — the bridge is imperceptibly shifting beneath your feet
2. **The destination moves** (Hell 2: Rola Bola) — where you're walking toward is not where you'll arrive
3. **The handrails are poisoned** (Hell 3: Saw Traps) — touching the structure for support infects your tools
4. **The fog rises** (Hell 4: Gorgon Swamp) — seven different toxins cloud your vision
5. **The wind picks up** (Hell 5: Fractal Wind) — the harder you try to stay straight, the more the wind pushes
6. **It starts raining** (Hell 6: Rain) — each raindrop carries a tiny contradiction
7. **Your compass lies** (Hell 7: Judas Echo) — your own instruments tell you you're on course when you're falling

### The Cruelest Part: The False Mirror

When the attacker gets close to giving up, AZAZEL does something remarkable: it *appears to surrender*. The data starts looking cleaner. The errors decrease. The attacker thinks they've cracked it.

They publish their results.

Then the data collapses. The "clean" data was a trap. Their published paper is wrong. Their reputation is damaged. And they never know it was intentional.

## Who Made This?

**The Architect** — Rafael Amichis Luengo, a researcher from Madrid who believes that the future of cybersecurity lies in making attacks psychologically devastating, not just computationally expensive.

**The Engine** — Claude (Anthropic), an AI system that designed and implemented the mathematical architecture.

**The Auditors** — Gemini (Google), ChatGPT (OpenAI), and Grok (xAI), three independent AI systems that spent multiple rounds trying to break the system and suggesting improvements.

This is one of the first cryptographic systems designed through genuine human-AI collaborative research, with multiple AI systems serving as both builders and adversaries.

## Can I Run It?

Yes. You need:

- A computer with Python 3 installed (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- No other software or libraries required

```bash
cd ~/Downloads && python3 AEGIS_AZAZEL_V5_BEAST4.py
```

The system runs in under 3 seconds and shows you the complete attack battery — proving that friends see clean data and enemies see chaos.

## Is This Legal?

Yes. The software is released under the Business Source License 1.1 with the **Azazel Clause** — a permanent ethical restriction that prevents anyone from using this technology for surveillance, oppression, weaponization, discrimination, or manipulation of democratic processes. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details.

## What's Next?

AZAZEL is Beast 4 in a sequence of 10. The next evolution — **ACHERON** (Beast 5) — will enter Phase III: Drain. Where AZAZEL infects the attacker's logic, ACHERON will drain their computational resources until their hardware surrenders.
